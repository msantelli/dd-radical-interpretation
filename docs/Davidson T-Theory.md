Below is a **clean, self-contained summary** of **T-theories** and **Radical Interpretation** in Donald Davidson, based strictly on the textual context provided from Glüer’s *Donald Davidson: A Short Introduction* and Davidson’s own essays in *Verdad y significado* (Truth and Meaning) , presented in a way suitable for an educational app.

# **Summary: T-Theory & Radical Interpretation in Donald Davidson**

## **1\. The Problem: What is it for words to mean what they do?**

Davidson begins with the fundamental question of the theory of meaning:

*“What is it for words to mean what they do?”*

He argues that to understand meaning we must examine **how interpreters understand utterances in actual communicative interaction**, not abstract linguistic entities. Meaning, for Davidson, is fundamentally **public**, **intersubjective**, and **rooted in communicative success**.

Thus, meaning theory is inseparable from **interpretation theory**.

---

## **2\. T-Theory (Truth-Theoretic Semantics)**

### **2.1 What a T-Theory is**

A **T-theory** is Davidson’s adaptation of Tarski’s formal theory of truth to natural language.

* A T-theory is a **formal axiomatic system** that generates **T-sentences** such as:

“’Snow is white’ is true iff snow is white.”

* It gives **truth conditions** for every sentence of a language.

* For Davidson, **truth conditions \= meaning**. Knowing the truth conditions of a sentence is knowing its meaning.

### **2.2 Why truth?**

Davidson rejects verificationism and instead treats truth (in Tarski’s technical sense) as the **basic semantic notion** that allows a compositional semantics for natural languages.

### **2.3 The role of compositionality**

A formal meaning theory must explain how finite speakers understand an infinite number of possible sentences. This requires a **compositional structure**:

* the meaning of a whole sentence is determined by  
   **(a)** the meanings of its parts \+ **(b)** the way they are combined.

Davidson thinks only a truth-theory can meet this requirement for natural language.

### **2.4 T-theory as a model of competence**

A T-theory is not something speakers *know explicitly*, but a **model** of their underlying competence:

“We cannot describe what an interpreter can do except by appeal to a recursive theory of a certain sort.”

---

## **3\. Radical Interpretation**

### **3.1 Why radical interpretation?**

To answer his second fundamental question—

*“How could we come to know such a theory?”* —

Davidson imagines a scenario:  
 an interpreter faces a **completely unknown language**, with **no prior knowledge** of its meanings.

This is the analogue to Quine’s field linguist, but Davidson uses it to frame the **epistemic constraints** on semantics.

### **3.2 What data does the radical interpreter have?**

Only:

1. **Observable behavior**, especially linguistic behavior.

2. **Observable circumstances of utterance** (the environment).

3. **Assumptions about rationality** (see §4 below).

This yields Davidson’s **weak semantic behaviorism**:

Meaning is *entirely determined* by publicly observable behavioral evidence.  
 (Though not *reducible* to behavior.)

### **3.3 The method**

The radical interpreter’s task:

* Construct the **best T-theory** that fits the behavioral evidence of a speaker.

* Interpret utterances by **finding truth conditions** that maximize the coherence and correctness of the speaker’s beliefs (this point leads into charity).

The interpreter must simultaneously:

* interpret **utterances**,

* attribute **beliefs**,

* understand **actions**.

Interpretation is holistic.

---

## **4\. The Principle of Charity**

Charity is the **core constraint** on interpretation.

### **4.1 Two main components**

According to Glüer’s reconstruction :

1. **Principle of Coherence**  
    — interpret the speaker so that their beliefs form a coherent system.

2. **Principle of Correspondence**  
    — assign mostly **true** beliefs about their environment whenever possible.

This means:

* The other person must be interpreted as **largely rational**,

* And as responding appropriately to **shared causes in the world**.

Charity is **constitutive** of thought and meaning itself: without assuming rationality and mostly true beliefs, interpretation cannot even get started.

---

## **5\. What the Model is Designed to Address**

### **5.1 Anti-skepticism**

Because interpretation requires assuming that most beliefs are true, Davidson concludes:

* Global skepticism about the external world or others’ minds is unintelligible.  
   Rational cognition *requires* a largely veridical background.

### **5.2 Anti-conventionalism**

Meaning does **not** depend on social conventions or fixed languages.

* Radical interpretation shows that the target of interpretation is the **idiolect** of each speaker.

* Communication succeeds because **temporary, occasion-specific** meanings are coordinated between speakers.

### **5.3 No private languages**

Because meaning is evidence-constituted and evidence must be public, there can be no genuinely private meaning.  
 (*Publicness of meaning* is a central motivation.)

### **5.4 Holism of mental content**

Beliefs, desires, utterances, and actions form a tightly interrelated system.  
 Interpretation applies to **whole persons**, not isolated sentences.

---

## **6\. Synthesis**

A Davidsonian account of meaning combines:

### **Formal Component**

* A **T-theory** giving truth conditions for sentences (a model of competence).

* Compositional, recursive, and empirically constrained.

### **Foundational Component**

* **Radical Interpretation** \+ **Charity** explaining how meaning is fixed.

* Meaning is **determined** by the evidence available to an interpreter.

* Evidence is **public behavior**, situated in the world.

### **Philosophical Import**

This model provides:

* an account of meaning without mentalist intermediaries,

* an argument for the objectivity and public nature of thought,

* a rejection of skepticism and private languages,

* a dynamic, individualistic, anti-conventional account of communication.

# **2\. Minimal Example: Constructing a T-Theory Fragment**

Below is the simplest Davidson-style mini-language:

* **Vocabulary**

  * Proper name: *Kurt*

  * Predicate: *is raining*

  * Sentence form: *It is raining*

We construct a Tarski-style truth theory for this tiny fragment.

---

## **Step 1 — Specify the target sentence**

Suppose the speaker utters:

**“Es regnet.”**

The interpreter wants to state equivalently:

“’Es regnet’ is true iff it is raining.”

That is the **T-sentence** we want to derive *from axioms*, not assume.

---

## **Step 2 — Axioms for the parts**

### **Axiom 1: Reference of lexical items**

For a weather predicate:

`T1: For any time t and place x,`

     `‘regnet’ is true of ⟨t, x⟩ iff it is raining at ⟨t, x⟩.`

### **Axiom 2: Structure of the sentence**

We give a syntactic rule mapping the whole sentence to the predicate:

`T2: For any time t and place x,`

     `‘Es regnet’ is true at ⟨t, x⟩ iff ‘regnet’ is true of ⟨t, x⟩.`

This is the compositional step.

---

## **Step 3 — Derive the T-sentence**

From T2 and T1:

`‘Es regnet’ is true at ⟨t, x⟩`

    `iff ‘regnet’ is true of ⟨t, x⟩`

    `iff it is raining at ⟨t, x⟩.`

Thus we obtain the **canonical T-sentence**:

**T(Es regnet): ‘Es regnet’ is true iff it is raining.**

This is the Davidsonian meaning-statement:

* It is **extensionally correct**.

* It is **derived compositionally**.

* It yields the **truth conditions**, which are the **meaning**.

## **Step 4 — Use in Interpretation**

The radical interpreter observes that the speaker utters “Es regnet”:

* when water is falling from the sky,

* when they seek shelter,

* when they hold up an umbrella,

* etc.

Maximizing coherence \+ truth, the interpreter concludes:

* the speaker believes it is raining in those circumstances,

* therefore, the T-sentence matches the behavioral data.

Thus, the theory both:

1. **Models linguistic competence** (how meaning is generated), and

2. **Explains meaning determination** (how meaning is fixed by evidence \+ charity).
